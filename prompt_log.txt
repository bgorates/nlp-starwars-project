CELL 1: DATA LOADING
"Write Python code to import pandas and requests. We need to load Star Wars scripts from these raw URLs:
1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamran786/Star-Wars-Movie-Scripts-Text-Analysis/master/SW_EpisodeIV.txt
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamran786/Star-Wars-Movie-Scripts-Text-Analysis/master/SW_EpisodeV.txt
3. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamran786/Star-Wars-Movie-Scripts-Text-Analysis/master/SW_EpisodeVI.txt

Important: Do NOT use pd.read_csv because the files have inconsistent spacing. Instead, use requests to download the text, split it by line, remove all quote characters, and then manually split each line into [Line Number, Character, Dialogue]. Combine all data into a DataFrame and print the head."

CELL 2: PREPROCESSING & UNIT TEST
"Write Python code to preprocess the text.
1. Import re, nltk, and unittest.
2. Download 'stopwords' and 'punkt' from nltk.
3. Create a function preprocess_text(text) that:
   - Converts text to lowercase.
   - Removes special characters (keeping only letters).
   - Removes stopwords and uses PorterStemmer.
4. Create a unittest.TestCase class to test that the input 'I am your Father!' correctly transforms into 'father'.
5. Run the unit test. If it passes, apply the function to the 'dialogue' column."

CELL 3: VISUALIZATION (EDA)
"Write code to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
1. Filter the DataFrame to keep only the Top 10 characters with the most lines.
2. Use seaborn to create a Bar Plot of these top 10 characters and their line counts.
3. Print the names of the top 10 characters."

CELL 4: WORD CLOUDS
"Write code to generate Word Clouds using the wordcloud library. Create a function that filters the data for a specific character and generates a word cloud from their dialogue. Generate clouds for YODA, VADER, and HAN."

CELL 5: MODEL TRAINING
"Write Python code to train a Machine Learning model.
1. Import train_test_split, TfidfVectorizer, and LogisticRegression.
2. Split the filtered data (Top 10 characters) into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using random_state=42.
3. Vectorize the text using TfidfVectorizer.
4. Train a LogisticRegression model and print the accuracy score."

CELL 6: EVALUATION
"Write Python code to evaluate the model. Generate a classification report and a Confusion Matrix using seaborn heatmap to show where the model confuses characters."

CELL 7: DEMO APPLICATION
"Create a demo application function predict_character(text) that takes a raw string, cleans it, vectorizes it (using the existing vectorizer), and predicts the character. Test it with custom quotes like 'I have a bad feeling about this' and 'The dark side is strong'."
